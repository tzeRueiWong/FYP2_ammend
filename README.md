This is the source code for my FYP2.
I did not upload the configuration key for the database, so this source code will most likely not work if anyone were to run it on their device.

Instead here is a hosted version of the project :
https://presentation-6yfgztsjibdgnj2dd4hm3b.streamlit.app/

Unfortunately the hosted version will not have the chatbot, as the authentication token requires frequent updates.
There is also a chance the hosted version may not work due to my account using a free plan.

if you see this image, pls click on the button on wait for the app to finish loading.
